            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              I loved the idea Marcus Aurelius followed - keeping a journal that would help him become a better parent, friend, stoic and emperor. He never meant to publish it. Yet here we are almost two thousands year later still finding pragmatic and overarching truths as we read it. I'm nowhere near thinking the "Number One Rules" would have a similar depth, weight and impact. I'm simply in love with the idea of putting thoughts "to paper", sharing them and letting things take shape. The main audience I kept in mind was my family, friends and self. The name "Number One Rules" comes from a running joke we had with the team at work. Whenever someone would make a mistake, the comment would usually be: "How could you forget the No. 1 Rule? Always ask for a discount!" or something of the sort.

              Not because it's an invaluable resource, but I can't escape the feeling that it could be a waste not to share any of the insights. Each of these at some point resonated deeply, helping make sense of a situation and hinting to a practical next step. If the same happens to a reader - fantastic! If not - nothing is lost. I would be absolutely delighted to see the rules of every person I've collaborated with in any capacity. Wouldn't it be like having a magical window into a person's way of thinking? You can also think of it as a "Working with..." doc on steroids.

              These are not necessarily eternal truths. Just claims I believe, but also just as willing to doubt at the exact same time. When applied or instantiated in a practical scenario - absolutely, one must make a choice what is true and live with the consequences. But in abstract context they're absolutely up for debate and, hopefully, improvement. What was true yesterday, needn't be true today. And vice versa. The contradictions are probably numerous, the wording imperfect, the advertised pragmatism hidden, but it beats an empty page or thoughts lost the next morning. Yet, the sense of some fundamental principles or a system of thought is present, e.g. a call for compassion, a belief in common human decency, and yes - welcoming of contradictions, mistakes and disagreements, even if its just an internal monologue. I totally expect to apply changes myself on a regular basis and keep this as a live document. I'm positive there's beautiful rules to be recorded, disproved and re-discovered. Last thing we need is another bible.

              Many claims were born out of research studies I read, mature schools of thought that intrigued or resonated with my own understanding of the world, or approaches that happened to repeatedly prove themselves in practice. However, I haven't tested all the hypothesis or respected the scientific method in developing the arguments for any of the rules. Still I believe in their truthfulness and, most of all, practicality in times of trouble, i.e. all of the continuous strife we call life. This I find as critical, because one would only sit down and read anything similar to find an answer. Sometimes for a very specific reason, sometimes out of thirst to find one. In every book, training or whatever knowledge resource you find - you don't intend to learn it by heart and apply dogmatically. You hope to discover a few things that would really count. The ones you would apply today and hopefully keep applying for the days to come. Others you'll forget and hopefully come back to later when their time comes. This is why I tried to filter them, because I'm convinced a time for each of these will come. And we'll never know when.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Going over the list too many and never enough times I always catch myself thinking just how cliché some of the rules are. This can certainly cause some to stop reading or skipping with increased confidence they could afford it. At the same time, clichés are often just simple truths that we're willing to keep at the mind's bottom at best meaning that bringing them up at the right time could be a spark for a "why didn't I think of that earlier" type of moment. So I kept them. After all, doesn't every good song sound at least vaguely familiar?

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">Why format the rules this way?</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The short title is for reference, but also to hopefully inspire a rhyming thought or sentiment with the reader. The description is meant to be long enough to provide the essence of a personal interpretation of a rule paired with anecdotal examples and/or stories to back it up. The categories I used refer to the three stoic disciplines (will, action, perception), three areas one person should professionally develop (self-, people and business/process management) and the contemporary, for the lack of a better word "corporate"-sounding skills used only to help organize the content in a manner slightly more intuitive than a randomly numbered list.

              Because they helped me or those around me move forward. Most tangibly this happened in the context of a company which I was lucky to be part of building. It was called Melon and got acquired around its 20th birthday. The name lost, but the spirit and values certainly not. In its prime it was often referred to as the "hidden gem". A cause for many locals to reignite their belief that there's an alternative to the "kiss up, kick down" attitude traditionally and lazily perceived the only possibility in a Balkan company. And a cause for many non-Balkan clients and partners to rediscover value and humanity where perhaps they'd not expect it. From beginning to end, I'm willing to argue it was living proof that a strong moral compass doesn't come at a cost of success. Which, I guess, would depend on any single person's definition, but this is exactly the type of discussion I would enjoy having.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-foreground">The AI factor</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              As I started writing these a parallel phenomenon was developing in the wider ether of reality. Artificial intelligence broke out from an abstract computer science term sporadically mentioned. and much less frequently understood, into anything from a life-changing, career-threatening tech to the final omen of our species' self-destructive tragicomic exit from meaningful existence. While I certainly joined following the news and the possibilities accompanying AI tools, the main question I kept asking was how the hell will this influence us sense of being human, mostly with each other. Drawing an analogy between the AI revolution and, say, industrial or internet revolution I don't think does it justice. The shift will be faster, deeper and broader.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              What happens when in a matter of several years hundreds of millions lose their jobs and more often than we'd like to think - their sense of purpose? As of yet, I've been (willfully, at that) unemployed for two months and the struggle to find purpose and everything that comes with it is very real. And this is just the more or less foreseeable beginning. Reality distortion mechanisms already in play will get supercharged, governments and regulatory systems will be vastly unprepared, other ongoing crises like global warming and major conflicts are likely too exacerbate as the focus shifts to the inevitable AI arms race. What do we do as parents? What do we do as friends and community members? What do we do as a species and, as far as we can tell, only self-aware inhabitants of Earth already barely managing the rapid changes around us?

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              As the willful suspension of disbelief kicks in, I started finding solace in truths that permeated across the ages as its the best I can come up with despite the claimed unprecedented impact I expect. I'm open to other suggestions (giving up on humanity is not on the menu). What I think we will need to do is to "out-human" AI. Come back to ourselves and each other. No one else will, I imagine. Not the governments, not the corporations or the messianic figures of today (e.g. "tech bros"). There's going to be pain, uncertainty and constant work - the only things anyone could ever guarantee. And, naively, I think there could be bits and pieces we can find in these rules that could be just enough to assemble a life-worthy puzzle.

              Oh, by the way: all content of the "Number One Rules" is human-generated. AI, if used, will be only to help usability and accessibility of the content, not creating or changing it beyond a rudimental spellcheck. That's for us humans to do, while we still can.
